# Project Architecture Overview

This project is divided into two main components: the Python-based Backend API and the Web Application. Together, they form a cohesive pipeline to process user requests, handle data, and present results.

## Backend API (Python)

1. **Request Handling:**  
   The API receives HTTP requests from the web application.

2. **Routing & Validation:**  
   Requests are directed to the appropriate endpoints with proper input validation, including authentication where required.

3. **Data Processing:**  
   Implements business logic, executes external API calls, and performs data transformations based on endpoint requirements.

4. **Database Interaction:**  
   The API communicates with the database to store, update, or retrieve data.

5. **Response Generation:**  
   Upon finishing the processing, the API returns a structured JSON response back to the web application.

## Web Application

1. **User Interface:**  
   Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input data and view results.

2. **API Consumption:**  
   The web app sends HTTP requests to the backend API and handles responses appropriately.

3. **Data Presentation:**  
   Processes the JSON responses from the API and dynamically renders the output for the user.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing independent scalability and maintenance of both the backend API and the web application.
